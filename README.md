# Testing Project

## Purpose of this repository

The main idea of this project is to test the files that we selected during the tests design.

The repository contains the source code that is under testing, a `package.json` skeleton, and a LICENSE file.

The source code folder contains a separate license file that must **NOT** be removed under any circumstances!
Removing this license file directly violates the terms and conditions of the software under testing.
Individuals who remove or modify the license file will also carry the consequences.
